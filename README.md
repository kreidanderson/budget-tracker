  ## Installation
  In order to use this app locally you will need to do "npm i" in order to install all the necessary modules. Otherwise, you will be able to use the app from the deployed heroku link.
 
   ## Goals 
   The goal of this project was to enable offline access to cached information. Additionally, it was to separate functions so they aren't all in the same file. Essentially it was to organize the code in a more streamlined way as well as create offline accessibility to the app.
